# Heart-Disease-detection-using-Machine-Learning-algorithm
heart disease detection in python using heart disease dataset from kaggle. Firstly data preprocessing is done
Genetic algorithm is used as feature selection 
Different classifiers are applied to determine which has greater percentage and then applied on the data to predict the heart diease.
classifiers: 1)Decision tree 2)Naive bayes 3)KNN algorithm applied
Confusion matrix of each classifier is determined 
according to clasifier accuracy percentage then that classifier is applied to detect heart disease.
