# Heart-Disease-detection-using-Machine-Learning-algorithm
heart disease detection in python using heart disease dataset from kaggle. Firstly data preprocessing is done and then Genetic algorithm is used as feature selection and then different classifiers are applied to determine which has greater percentage and then applied on the data to predict the heart diease.
